# Neural-Network
Simple neural network implementation. Trained on addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. 
It trains the model on the specified function then it has an infinite loop to try out different user specified inputs.

## Steps
1. Input 2 numbers (they can be real numbers)

## Result
The two values will go through a neural net and display the output.
